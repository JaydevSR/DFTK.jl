#nb # DFTK is a Julia package for playing with plane-wave
#nb # density-functional theory algorithms. In its basic formulation it
#nb # solves periodic Kohn-Sham equations.
#
# This document provides an overview of the structure of the code
# and how to access basic information about calculations.
# Basic familiarity with the concepts of plane-wave density functional theory
# is assumed throughout.
#
# !!! note "Convergence parameters in the documentation"
#     We use very rough parameters in order to be able
#     to generate these docs quickly. Therefore results are far from converged
#     and tighter thresholds and larger grids should be used for more realistic results.
#
# For our discussion we will use the classic example of
# computing the LDA ground state of the silicon crystal.
# Performing such a calculation roughly proceeds in three steps.

using DFTK

## 1. Define lattice and atomic positions
a = 10.26  # Silicon lattice constant in Bohr
lattice = a / 2 * [[0 1 1.];
                   [1 0 1.];
                   [1 1 0.]]

## Load HGH pseudopotential for Silicon
Si = ElementPsp(:Si, psp=load_psp("hgh/lda/Si-q4"))

## Specify type and positions of atoms
atoms = [Si => [ones(3)/8, -ones(3)/8]]

## 2. Select model and basis
model = model_LDA(lattice, atoms)
kgrid = [4, 4, 4]  # k-point grid (Regular Monkhorst-Pack grid)
Ecut = 7           # kinetic energy cutoff in Hartree
basis = PlaneWaveBasis(model, Ecut; kgrid=kgrid)

## 3. Run the SCF procedure to obtain the ground state
scfres = self_consistent_field(basis, tol=1e-8);

# DFTK by default applies the convergence tolerance `tol`
# to the energy difference, so that the norm in the density difference
# is not yet converged to 8 digits.

# ## Units in DFTK
# For all quantities DFTK uses
# [atomic units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree_atomic_units),
# where lengths are in Bohr, energies in Hartree and so on.
# For conversion to other units, DFTK provides conversion factors
# in the `DFTK.units` module.
# The convention is that the conversion factors convert *into* atomic units,
# therefore multiply to convert into the DFTK convention and divide
# to convert to other units[^1]:
#
# [^1]:
#     To enter unicode characters like Å in the Julia REPL or a Jupyter notebook
#     type their latex command (`\AA`) and press TAB. For common editors
#     there are [Julia plugins](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport),
#     which provide the same functionality.

import DFTK.units: eV, Å
10eV      # 10eV in Hartree
#-
1.2 / Å  # 1.2 Bohr in Ångström

# !!! warning "Differing unit conventions"
#     Different electronic-structure codes use different unit conventions.
#     For example for lattice vectors the common length units
#     are bohr (used by DFTK) and Ångström (used e.g. by ASE, 1Å ≈ 1.80 bohr).
#     When setting up a calculation for DFTK
#     one needs to ensure to convert to bohr and atomic units.
#     For some Python libraries (currently ASE, pymatgen and abipy)
#     DFTK directly ships conversion tools in form of the [`load_lattice`](@ref)
#     and [`load_atoms`](@ref) functions,
#     which take care of such conversions. Examples, which demonstrate this
#     are [Creating slabs with ASE](@ref) and [Creating supercells with pymatgen](@ref).

# Computations take place in the unit cell of a lattice defined by a ``3 × 3``
# matrix (`model.lattice`) with lattice vectors as columns.
# Denoting this matrix by ``A``, the corresponding reciprocal lattice,
# that is the lattice of Fourier coefficients,
# is defined by
# ```math
# B = 2\pi A^{-T} = 2π {A^{T}}^{-1}
# ```
# and is available in DFTK as `model.recip_lattice`.
# Consequently:

1/2π * model.recip_lattice' * model.lattice

# !!! warning "Row-major versus column-major storage order"
#     Julia stores matrices as column-major, but other languages
#     (notably Python and C) use row-major ordering.
#     Care therefore needs to be taken to properly
#     transpose the unit cell matrices ``A`` before using it with DFTK.
#     For the supported third-party packages `load_lattice`
#     and `load_atoms` again handle such conversion automatically.

# A more detailed overview over the conventions used inside DFTK,
# such as the coordinate systems used to express vectors in real or reciprocal space
# or the typical symbols to denote key quantities in the code, see
# [Notation and conventions](@ref).

# ## `Model` datastructure
# The physical model to be solved is defined by the `Model`
# datastructure. It contains the unit cell, number of electrons, atoms,
# type of spin polarization and temperature. Each atom has an atomic
# type (`Element`) specifying the number of valence electrons and the
# potential (or pseudopotential) it creates with respect to the electrons.
# The `Model` structure also contains the list of energy terms
# defining the energy functional to be minimised during the SCF.
# For the silicon example above, we used
# an LDA model, which consists of the following terms[^2]:
#
# [^2]: If you are not familiar with Julia syntax, this is equivalent to `[typeof(t) for t in model.term_types]`.

typeof.(model.term_types)

# DFTK computes energies for all terms of the model individually,
# which are available in `scfres.energies`:

scfres.energies
#
# For now the following energy terms are available in DFTK:

# - Kinetic energy
# - Local potential energy, either given by analytic potentials or
#   specified by the type of atoms.
# - Nonlocal potential energy, for norm-conserving pseudopotentials
# - Nuclei energies (Ewald or pseudopotential correction)
# - Hartree energy
# - Exchange-correlation energy
# - Power nonlinearities (useful for Gross-Pitaevskii type models)
# - Magnetic field energy
# - Entropy term

# Custom types can be added if needed. For examples see
# the definition of the above terms in the
# [`src/terms`](https://dftk.org/tree/master/src/terms) directory.
#src TODO Refer to an example showing how to add / build custom terms

# By mixing and matching these terms, the user can create custom models
# not limited to DFT. Convenience constructors are provided for common cases:
#
# - `model_LDA`: LDA model using the
#   [Teter parametrisation](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.54.1703)
# - `model_DFT`: Assemble a DFT model using
#    any of the LDA or GGA functionals of the
#    [libxc](https://tddft.org/programs/libxc/functionals/) library,
#    for example:
#    ```
#    model_DFT(lattice, atoms, [:gga_x_pbe, :gga_c_pbe])
#    model_DFT(lattice, atoms, :lda_xc_teter93)
#    ```
#    where the latter is equivalent to `model_LDA`.
#    Specifying no functional is the reduced Hartree-Fock model:
#    ```
#    model_DFT(lattice, atoms, [])
#    ```
# - `model_atomic`: A linear model, which contains no electron-electron interaction
#   (neither Hartree nor XC term).


# ## `PlaneWaveBasis` and plane-wave discretisations
#src TODO Some of this is a bit technical and should probably be factored
#src      out into a "background theory section"

# The `PlaneWaveBasis` datastructure handles the discretization of a
# given `Model` in a plane-wave basis.
# In plane-wave methods the discretization is twofold:
# Once the ``k``-point grid, which determines the sampling
# *inside* the Brillouin zone and on top of that a finite
# plane-wave grid to discretise the lattice-periodic functions.
# The former aspect is controlled by the `kgrid` argument
# of `PlaneWaveBasis`, the latter is controlled by the
# cutoff energy parameter `Ecut`:

PlaneWaveBasis(model, Ecut; kgrid=kgrid)

# The `PlaneWaveBasis` by default uses symmetry to reduce the number of
# `k`-points explicitly treated. For details see [Crystal symmetries](@ref).

# As mentioned, the periodic parts of Bloch waves are expanded
# in a set of normalized plane waves ``e_G``:
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
#   \psi_{k}(x) &= e^{i k \cdot x} u_{k}(x)\\
#   &= \sum_{G \in \mathcal R^{*}} c_{G}  e^{i  k \cdot  x} e_{G}(x)
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# where ``\mathcal R^*`` is the set of reciprocal lattice vectors.
# The ``c_{{G}}`` are ``\ell^{2}``-normalized. The summation is truncated to a
# "spherical", ``k``-dependent basis set
# ```math
#   S_{k} = \left\{G \in \mathcal R^{*} \,\middle|\, \frac 1 2 |k+ G|^{2} \le E_\text{cut}\right\}
# ```
# where ``E_\text{cut}`` is the cutoff energy.

# Densities involve terms like ``|\psi_{k}|^{2} = |u_{k}|^{2}`` and
# therefore products ``e_{-{G}} e_{{G}'}`` for ``{G}, {G}'`` in
# ``S_{k}``. To represent these we use a "cubic", ``k``-independent
# basis set large enough to contain the set
# ``\{{G}-G' \,|\, G, G' \in S_{k}\}``.
# We can obtain the coefficients of densities on the
# ``e_{G}`` basis by a convolution, which can be performed efficiently
#md # with FFTs (see [`G_to_r`](@ref) and [`r_to_G`](@ref) functions).
#nb # with FFTs (see `G_to_r` and `r_to_G` functions).
# Potentials are discretized on this same set.

# The normalization conventions used in the code is that quantities
# stored in reciprocal space are coefficients in the ``e_{G}`` basis,
# and quantities stored in real space use real physical values.
# This means for instance that wavefunctions in the real space grid are
# normalized as ``\frac{|\Omega|}{N} \sum_{r} |\psi(r)|^{2} = 1`` where
# ``N`` is the number of grid points.

# For example let us check the normalization of the first eigenfunction
# at the first ``k``-point in reciprocal space:

ψtest = scfres.ψ[1][:, 1]
sum(abs2.(ψtest))

# We now perform an IFFT to get ψ in real space. The ``k``-point has to be
# passed because ψ is expressed on the ``k``-dependent basis.
# Again the function is normalised:

ψreal = G_to_r(basis, basis.kpoints[1], ψtest)
sum(abs2.(ψreal)) * model.unit_cell_volume / prod(basis.fft_size)

# The list of ``k`` points of the basis can be obtained with `basis.kpoints`.

basis.kpoints

# The ``G`` vectors of the "spherical", ``k``-dependent grid can be obtained
# with `G_vectors`:

[length(G_vectors(kpoint)) for kpoint in basis.kpoints]
#-
ik = 1
G_vectors(basis.kpoints[ik])[1:4]

# The list of ``G`` vectors (Fourier modes) of the "cubic", ``k``-independent basis
# set can be obtained similarly with `G_vectors(basis)`.

length(G_vectors(basis)), prod(basis.fft_size)
#-
collect(G_vectors(basis))[1:4]
#-

# Analogously the list of ``r`` vectors
# (real-space grid) can be obtained with `r_vectors(basis)`:

length(r_vectors(basis))
#-
collect(r_vectors(basis))[1:4]

# ## Accessing Bloch waves and densities
# Wavefunctions are stored in an array `scfres.ψ` as `ψ[ik][iG, iband]` where
# `ik` is the index of the kpoint (in `basis.kpoints`), `iG` is the
# index of the plane wave (in `G_vectors(basis.kpoints[ik])`) and
# `iband` is the index of the band.
# Densities are usually stored in a
# special type, `RealFourierArray`, from which the representation in
# real and reciprocal space can be accessed using `ρ.real` and
# `ρ.fourier` respectively.

using Plots  # hide
rvecs = collect(r_vectors(basis))[:, 1, 1]  # slice along the x axis
x = [r[1] for r in rvecs]                   # only keep the x coordinate
plot(x, scfres.ρ.real[:, 1, 1], label="", xlabel="x", ylabel="ρ", marker=2)
#-
G_energies = [sum(abs2.(model.recip_lattice * G)) ./ 2 for G in G_vectors(basis)][:]
scatter(G_energies, abs.(scfres.ρ.fourier[:]);
        yscale=:log10, ylims=(1e-12, 1), label="", xlabel="Energy", ylabel="|ρ|^2")

# Note that the density has no components on wavevectors above a certain energy,
# because the wavefunctions are limited to ``\frac 1 2|k+G|^2 ≤ E_{\rm cut}``.

# ## Band structure calculations
# Once an SCF solution has been computed, DFTK offers various
# functions for post-processing, one being the plotting of a band structure:

n_bands = 8
p = plot_bandstructure(scfres, n_bands, kline_density=5, unit=:eV)
p
#
#md # !!! tip "kline_density"
#     In this example we deliberately used an extremely small value
#     for `kline_density` to speed up execution. In practice values
#     of `10` or larger are recommended.
#     The default value is `20` and provides pretty smooth bands.
